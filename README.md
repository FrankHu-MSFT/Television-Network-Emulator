# Television-Network-Emulator
Feeling more confident in it

Inspired by kur0san. Unfortunately the program absolutely less than stellar... In theory the timer should work correctly. however, still testing. 

Please don't press the start button more than once, it messes up if you do that.
This application needs to have the start button disabled after pressing start...? Possible idea

This program essentially emulates a television network. It will play videos according to what the time is. i.e 1:30 will play the folder of videos that you designated at 1:30, and once it's 2:00 it will switch folders.
