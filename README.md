# Television-Network-Emulator
Feeling more confident in it

Inspired by kur0san. Unfortunately the program absolutely less than stellar... In theory the timer should work correctly. however, still testing. 

This program essentially emulates a television network. It will play videos according to what the time is. i.e 1:30 will play the folder of videos that you designated at 1:30, and once it's 2:00 it will switch folders.
