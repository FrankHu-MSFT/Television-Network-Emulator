# Television-Network-Emulator
Buggy... In theory this should work correctly...

Inspired by kur0se. Unfortunately the program absolutely less than stellar... In theory the timer should work correctly. however, still testing. 

This program essentially emulates a television network. It will play videos according to what the time is. i.e 1:30 will play the folder of videos that you designated at 1:30, and once it's 2:00 it will switch folders.
